            <head>History of the Collection</head>
            <p>Malachi Ritscher, formerly Mark David Ritscher, was born in Dickinson, North Dakota in 1954. 
                In 1981 Mr. Ritscher moved to Chicago where he played bass guitar in several musical groups (Want Not, Arsenal and Book of Holy Lies.) 
                Mr. Ritscher worked at the University of Chicago as a maintenance engineer for much of his time in Chicago.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ritscher was well known in Chicago not only as a passionate fan of the local music scene but as an accomplished and meticulous documentarian. 
                Mr. Ritscher attended thousands of musical performances, many of which he recorded using various handheld recording devices. 
                His early cassette recordings from the 1980s capture a wide range of local, national and international artists performing in Chicago venues. 
                These cassettes contain otherwise unavailable live recordings of notable artists and groups such as Nirvana, James Brown, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Bauhaus, Ministry, 
                the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Laurie Anderson.</p>
            <p>In the late 1980s Mr. Ritscher began making high fidelity recordings of performances using a handheld Digital Audio Tape recorder (DAT). 
                While Mr. Ritscher continued to document performances of well-known artists, the vast majority of these later recordings were of concerts in the idiom of creative and 
                improvised music with particular attention paid to local artists such as Ken Vandermark, Josh Abrams, Jeff Parker, Hamid Drake, Dave Rempis and Michael Zerang. 
                These recordings often featured collaborations between Chicago artists and visiting European musicians. 
                Mr. Ritscher recorded these performances at various local venues including the Velvet Lounge and the Empty Bottle.</p>
            <p>After his death in 2006, Mr. Ritscher willed his collection of recordings to longtime friend Bruno Johnson to administer and disperse. 
                In 2004 Mr. Johnson contacted the Experimental Sound Studios and later donated the collection to the repositories’ Creative Audio Archives for research and preservation.  </p>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The Malachi Ritscher Collection (1981-2006) contains over 4,000 sound recordings and 438 unique ephemeral pieces. 
                The recordings of concerts, primarily in the idioms of creative jazz and improvised music dating from the early 1980s to 2006, 
                mostly recorded in Chicago, document the work of Chicago musicians. This includes numerous recordings of Chicago musicians collaborating 
                with important European improvisers, such as Peter Brötzmann, Derek Bailey, Ab Baars, Mats Gustafsson, and others, as well as many concerts 
                by members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, such as Roscoe Mitchell, Hamid Drake, Fred Anderson, Harrison Bankhead, and others. 
                There are also rare recordings of singular events, such as the 1981 Women’s Jazz Festival in Kansas City, and complete recordings of the Empty Bottle Jazz Festivals from 1999-2004. 
                The collection also contains some of the recording and playback equipment Mr. Ritscher used to make his recordings as well as recording logs, set lists and fliers from performances 
                he recorded and recordings of musical groups he played in.</p>
